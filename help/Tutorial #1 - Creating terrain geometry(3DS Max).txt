1. Required Tools
=================
- 3DS Max(duh)
- Easy Ogre Max Exporter for 3DS Max.

You can get the tool from the URL in the export_scripts folder. Pick the appropiate version for your Max.


2. Guidelines for modeling
==========================

- EOE relies on units set to Meters instead of inches if you want to export your stage in 1:1 proportion.

- If you're using EOE, you should model your stage around the regular Z Axis as UP, even if the game uses the Y axis instead. It'll do the appropiate conversions on its own.

- Don't use Max Groups or Mesh Linking. Those aren't useful to the Ogre Exporter at all and are likely to cause issues, since the game
doesn't really work in that style of grouping.

- Expanding the point above, your models should be pretty much as how you think of objects. See a palm tree? Make a single node as a palm tree. See a mountain? Make the node a mountain. See a door? Make the node a door! You should use Mesh attach if you want meshes to be
part of the same Node. Multi-materials are supported so you can do proper mapping if you need to.

=====================================================================
- USE DDS TEXTURES. That's the only format supported by the game.   =
=====================================================================

- Don't use more than 1 UV channel if you don't need to. The second UV channel is used for GIA information later on.

- While Easy Ogre Exporter does a good job in creating materials, you can't expect it to make 1:1 representations of anything fancy you make
in Max. It's built for a game engine after all. Keep it down to simple texture unit mapping(diffuse, bump maps, etc.) and you'll be fine.

- Don't make huge objects if you don't need to, nor make your entire stage a single mesh. That's largely inefficient. To work in the same
way the game does, nodes should be appropiately sized and diverse across the stage. If one of your objects is covering the entire world with
the bounding box, you're likely doing it wrong.

- Support for special mesh types such as transparent, water, etc., will come later on.

- Make sure you at least have one directional light in the scene(you can use the 3DS Max one if needed). And keep a note of the name you give it, since you'll need it later on.


3. Exporting your scene
=======================

- Once you're set with your stage, go to File > Export, and select the Ogre .scene format. (Not Ogre Max .scene one)

- In the configuration window for the exporter, choose "Ogre 1.7" as the version to export to(support for 1.8 will likely come later),
and clear all the sub-paths to blank. Check Build Tangents if you want but it's not technically needed if you don't have bumpy materials.

- Select a simple, empty folder to export to. This should help you keep your assets organized and it'll be easier for the editor to find stuff later on when importing.
